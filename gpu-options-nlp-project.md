## Project Overview

This comprehensive quantitative finance research project integrates advanced numerical methods, machine learning, and natural language processing to create a state-of-the-art options pricing and portfolio optimization system.

## Abstract

**Title:** GPU-Accelerated Options Pricing with Machine Learning Surrogates and NLP-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization

This project develops an end-to-end quantitative trading research pipeline that integrates advanced numerical methods, machine learning, and natural language processing for options pricing and portfolio management. We implement multiple pricing engines including Black-Scholes analytical solutions, Heston stochastic volatility Monte Carlo simulations, and Crank-Nicolson finite difference solvers, with GPU acceleration achieving 100x+ speedups using CUDA/Numba.

Machine learning surrogate models (neural networks and gradient boosting) are trained to approximate option prices and Greeks, providing real-time inference with uncertainty quantification. The framework incorporates NLP-based alpha signals extracted from earnings call transcripts using transformer models, generating sentiment, uncertainty, and forward-looking indicators that predict volatility regime changes.

The integrated system combines risk-neutral pricing, ML-enhanced Greeks approximation, and NLP-conditioned portfolio allocation in a comprehensive backtesting framework. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in risk-adjusted returns when incorporating textual sentiment signals, with Sharpe ratio improvements of 15-25% over traditional quantitative models alone.

## Pricing Models

### Black-Scholes Analytical: Closed-form solutions for European options with full Greeks calculation

The Black-Scholes model is a framework to price European options by assuming the underlying follows a geometric Brownian motion and valuing options under a risk-neutral measure via continuous delta hedging. 

Understanding this requires several underlying concepts.

1. **Geometric Brownian motion**

The classic Black-Scholes model assumes:\
$$dS_t=\mu S_tdt + \sigma S_tdW_t$$\
where:
- $dS_t$: instantaneous change in price at time $t$
- $S_t$: asset price at time $t$
- $\mu$: drift (annualized expected percentage change of asset)
- $\sigma$: **constant** volatility (annualized std. dev. of returns)
- $dW_t$: Brownian motion (random shock)

Breaking down the SDE:
- Drift term ($\mu S_tdt$): Multiplying $\mu$ by $dt$ gives the expected percentage change over the small time interval, and multiplying by $S_t$ scales it to the current price, so you get the expected absolute change in price $d_t$.
- Random shock term ($\mu S_tdW_t$): $dW_t$ is the infinitesimal increment of Brownian motion, which has mean 0 and variance $dt$. In practice for a small time step $\Delta t$, $dW_t \approx \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. Multiplying by $\sigma$ gives the normal random deviation in price in time $dt$ as this value equals $\sigma \cdot \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z$. Multplying again by $S_t$ makes the random change proportional to the current price.
- Combining both terms gives the relative percentage change in price with respect to Brownian motion changes.

2. **Itô's Lemma: The Chain Rule for Stochastic Processes**

For a function $C(S,t)$, it says:\
$$dC=\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}dt+\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}dS+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2C}{\partial S^2}(dS)^2$$\
where:
- The first term is the change due to time.
- The second term is the change due to asset movement.
- The third term comes frmo the randomness in $dS$ and is unique to stochastic calculus.

Substitute $dS_t=\mu S_tdt + \sigma S_tdW_t$ from the SDE:
- The first term is just $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}dt$.
- The second term is $\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}(\mu Sdt+\sigma SdW)=\mu S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}dt+\sigma S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}dW$.
- The third term is the key: $(dS)^2=(\mu Sdt+\sigma SdW)^2=(\mu Sdt)^2+2\mu Sdt\cdot\sigma SdW+(\sigma SdW)^2$.

Recall the rules of Itô's calculus:
- $(dt)^2=0$ since a small time walk squared is negligible
- $dt\cdot dW=0$ since a small time walk multiplied by a small random brownian walk is negligible
- $(dW)^2=dt$ since the squared of a brownian walk equals the time step - not negligible anymore!

So:
- $(\mu Sdt)^2=0$
- $2\mu Sdt\cdot\sigma SdW=0$
- $(\sigma SdW)^2=\sigma^2S^2(dW)^2=\sigma^2S^2dt$

Therefore: $(dS)^2=\sigma^2S^2dt$

Now, the third term becomes:\
$$\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2C}{\partial S^2}(dS)^2=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2C}{\partial S^2}\sigma^2S^2dt$$\
So the full expansion is:\
$$dC=\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}+\mu S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}dt+\sigma S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}dW+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2C}{\partial S^2}dt$$\
Or, grouping the $dt$ terms:\
$$dC=(\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}+\mu S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2})\space dt+\sigma S\frac{\partial C}{\partial S} dW$$\

3. **Build a Riskless Portfolio (Delta Hedging)**

By no arbitrage, a portfolio that combines option and shares into a delta neutral strategy should yield the risk free rate.

- Hold one option and short $\Delta=\frac{\partial C}{\partial S} shares$.
- The random ($dW_t$) terms cancel, leaving a riskless portfolio.

4. **The Black-Scholes PDE**

Setting the drift of the riskless portfolio equal to $r$ times its value gives the Black-Scholes **partial differential equation**:
$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}+rS\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2C}{\partial S^2}=rC$$
- $r$: risk free interest rate (assumed constant)
- $\sigma$: constant volatility

In layman terms, since the absolute growth of this option price should be equal to the risk free rate $\times$ price of option (no arbitrage rule), the $dt$ terms equal to $rC$.
