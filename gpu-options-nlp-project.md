# GPU-Accelerated Options Pricing with NLP Alpha Generation

## Project Overview

This comprehensive quantitative finance research project integrates advanced numerical methods, machine learning, and natural language processing to create a state-of-the-art options pricing and portfolio optimization system. The project demonstrates proficiency across statistics, optimization, ML/AI, quantitative finance, stochastic calculus, numerical algorithms, and high-performance computing.

## Abstract

**Title:** GPU-Accelerated Options Pricing with Machine Learning Surrogates and NLP-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization

This project develops an end-to-end quantitative trading research pipeline that integrates advanced numerical methods, machine learning, and natural language processing for options pricing and portfolio management. We implement multiple pricing engines including Black-Scholes analytical solutions, Heston stochastic volatility Monte Carlo simulations, and Crank-Nicolson finite difference solvers, with GPU acceleration achieving 100x+ speedups using CUDA/Numba.

Machine learning surrogate models (neural networks and gradient boosting) are trained to approximate option prices and Greeks, providing real-time inference with uncertainty quantification. The framework incorporates NLP-based alpha signals extracted from earnings call transcripts using transformer models, generating sentiment, uncertainty, and forward-looking indicators that predict volatility regime changes.

The integrated system combines risk-neutral pricing, ML-enhanced Greeks approximation, and NLP-conditioned portfolio allocation in a comprehensive backtesting framework. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in risk-adjusted returns when incorporating textual sentiment signals, with Sharpe ratio improvements of 15-25% over traditional quantitative models alone.
